== DESCRIPTION:

Independent random value generator supporting a number of 1-D and 2-D continuous probability distributions.

== FEATURES:

* Support for uniform, triangular and normal (aka gaussian) distributions both in 1-D and 2-D

== PROBLEMS:

* Complete lack of test code.

== SYNOPSIS:

  require 'irvag/unidimensional/gaussian'

  g = IRVaG::Unidimensional::Gaussian.new #=> #<IRVaG::Unidimensional::Gaussian:0x7f98682ede40 @std_dev=1.0, @mean=0.0>

  require 'irvag/unidimensional/all'

  include IRVaG::Unidimensional

  u = Uniform.new((1.0/3)**0.5, 2) #=> #<IRVaG::Unidimensional::Uniform:0x7f98682cb340 @max_half_amp=1.0, @mean=2>


== REQUIREMENTS:

* hoe
* fileutils

(required by all newgem's gem)

== INSTALL:

* FIX (sudo gem install, anything else)
